### Introduction

ABIS-demo-wallet is an initial implementation the [ABIS protocol](https://github.com/ABISprotocol/ABIS) on top of a Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) Bitcoin desktop client.

This project started as a fork of the popular Bitcoin client [Multibit](https://multibit.org/) and was renamed in order to avoid confusion with the original software, as requested by [Jim Burton](https://github.com/jim618).

As of this writing, only a non-working menu item was added to the Tools menu, in order to illustrate the intended feature. Further development will follow, pending successful fundraising to support this project.

Please check back later for a fully working client supporting easy donations with your every transaction.
